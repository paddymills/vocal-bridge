# Vocal Bridge: Digital Voice Solutions for Laryngectomy Patients
#
# Description
Vocal Bridge is an app meant to help laryngectomy patients communicate more fluidly after their procedure. Our aim is to give the patient access to an A.I. voice library where they can select a voice to use, or they can record their own voice before the surgery to synthesize an A.I. version.
